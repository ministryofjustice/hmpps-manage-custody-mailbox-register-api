A centralised functional mailbox registry providing email addresses for probation and prisons. The service would act 
as a source of truth for functional mailbox email addresses that services across HMPPS can use.

## Running the application locally

The application comes with a `dev` spring profile that includes default settings for running locally. This is not
necessary when deploying to kubernetes as these values are included in the helm configuration templates -
e.g. `values-dev.yaml`.

There is also a `docker-compose.yml` that can be used to run a local instance of the application in docker and also an
instance of HMPPS Auth (required if your service calls out to other services using a token).

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up
```

will build the application and run it and HMPPS Auth within a local docker instance.

## Running the application in IntelliJ

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up --scale hmpps-manage-custody-mailbox-register-api=0
```

will just start a docker instance of HMPPS Auth. The application should then be started with a `dev` active profile
in Intellij.
